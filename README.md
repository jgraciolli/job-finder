# ðŸ’¼ Job Finder

I created this basic website that simulates a tech job positions finder, where users can search for and post new job openings.
Technologies used: **Node.js**, **Express**, **Sequelize ORM**, **Handlebars**, and **SQLite**.

As a first project, only Read and Post functionalities are implemented (not full CRUD). 

For data storage I used an `app.db` SQLite file, so there's no separate database server running.

## I divided tasks this way:

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap and Handlebars for templating;
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Sequelize and SQLite.
